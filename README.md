# Flight Calculator

A simple burn rate calculator for the UH-60 helicopter. This was intended as a very quick project so the lazy do not have to keep track of tedious calculations. Also the idea was to expand upon it to allow greater functionality or other mundane calculations and thus ease the end user and allow them to merely fly without worry.
